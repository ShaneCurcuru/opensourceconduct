## [Welcome to Open Source Conduct](https://opensourceconduct.com/)!

Open Source Conduct is built upon the many, many excellent guides and how-tos for everything open source, serving as your curated introduction to the basics of everything about free and open source.  In particular, great thanks go to the many people who have build thoughtful codes of conduct, and have helped many FOSS projects become more inclusive, polite, and respectful of all participants.
