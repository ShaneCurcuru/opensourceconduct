FOUNDATION_TEMPLATE To add a listing for a new commonly used Code of Conduct, copy this file and then fill in as much data as you can verify against official sources in the YAML frontmatter fields above.  The data schema is in the _data/cocpolicy-schema.json file.  Then replace this section (i.e. the content of a Jekyll document) with a brief description or other data about this specific COC.  Submit a PR with this new identifier.md file in the _cocs directory.
