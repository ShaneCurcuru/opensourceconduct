title: Widely Reused CoCs
datafile: corecoc

Several Code of Conducts are widely re-used by other groups.  Some, 
like Contributor Covenant, were specifically written to be a reuseable 
CoC for FOSS projects; others like Debian CoC were written for their 
own projects, but achieved a widespread popularity.  Since these are all 
meant for open source projects, check the license when you use one.

The [Code of Conduct in Open Source Projects](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/SANER2017.pdf) 
2017 paper studied which CoCs were reused the most often (they're all included below); there are new
[research tools on GitHub](https://github.com/benbalter/coconductor) today to try to detect the style of CoC in various repositories.
