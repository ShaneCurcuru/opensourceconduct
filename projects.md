Here's a brief listing of some major FOSS and open source foundations, 
projects, and communities, and their published Code of Conduct(s).  
Note this only includes widely-known projects or larger communities 
that are at least partly community-governed.  This list is not intended 
to cover various corporate-run open source projects, nor does it cover 
projects without a functional and positive CoC.
